[^1]: PEGI
The ISFE (Interactive Software Federation of Europe) founded PEGI (Pan-European Game Information) in 2003, a system for classifying video games by age and content. The primary objective of PEGI is not restrictive, but informative. By knowing the pictograms, parents can see at a glance the nature of the content of a game and thus avoid putting unsuitable games in their children's hands.
